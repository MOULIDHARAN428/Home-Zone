## 💡 Inspiration
- As a woman, especially one who is homeless or a refugee, it is hard to find a room or house on their own.
- So, to make the search easier, we created Home Zone.

## 💻 What it does
- Home Zone is a user-friendly website.
- People who like to give their room/house to homeless or refugee people and enrol their details in the registration form. So, we can notify women of nearby locations for their stay if needed.
- Also homeless/refugee can enroll their details so that house owners can contact them directly.

## ⚙️ How we built it
- We made our client-end using HTML, CSS and jQuery.
- We made our server-end using PHP and MySQL for database.
